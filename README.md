## Introduction
The Simon Game is a memory skill game where players need to repeat sequences of colors (and corresponding sounds) generated by the game. The sequences become progressively longer and more complex as the game continues. This project implements the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery.

## Features
- Generates random sequences of colors.
- Plays sounds corresponding to each color.
- Animates button presses.
- Checks user input against the generated sequence.
- Displays game over message and resets game upon incorrect input.
